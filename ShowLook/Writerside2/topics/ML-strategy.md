# ML strategy

## Concept

We intend to employ generative Machine Learning models, 
enabling us to initiate learning without the need for existing data. 
Our training process will be organized into generations, 
with each generation consisting of 100 models responsible for generating outfits.

During each training iteration, users will evaluate 100 outfits generated by each model. 
Our algorithm will then identify and select the best-performing outfit from each model, 
serving as the starting point for the subsequent generation of 100 models. 
This iterative cycle will persist 
until a consensus is reached that our model has reached a sufficient level of training, 
at which point we can consider it ready for commercialization.

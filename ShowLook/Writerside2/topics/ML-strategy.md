# ML strategy

## Concept

We will use a generative Machine Learning models. It allows us to without any data start learning the models.
Our training will be split by generations. Each generation will have 100 models that will generate outfits.
Users will rate 100 outfits each model, and our algorithm will choose the best one, and that will be the start point for the
next generation of 100 models. The cycle will continue when we agree that our model is trained enough to sell it.
